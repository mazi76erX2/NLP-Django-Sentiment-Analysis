# nlp-django-sentiment-analysis
A high-throughput NLP API using Django REST to perform sentiment analysis on text input.

## Justifications

- **Django REST Framework**: Django REST Framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs. It is a popular choice for building APIs in Django projects. It is well-documented and has a large community, which makes it easy to find solutions to common problems.
- **OpenAPI**: OpenAPI is a specification for building APIs. It provides a standard way to describe APIs, which makes it easier to understand and work with APIs. It also provides tools for generating client libraries and documentation, which can be very useful when building and consuming APIs.
- **TensorFlow**: TensorFlow is a popular machine learning library that provides tools for building and training deep learning models. It is widely used in the machine learning community and has a large number of pre-trained models that can be used for various tasks.
- **Docker**: Docker is a popular tool for building, shipping, and running applications in containers. It provides a lightweight and portable way to package applications and their dependencies, which makes it easy to deploy applications in different environments.
- **cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment**: This is a pre-trained RoBERTa model that has been fine-tuned on a sentiment analysis task. It is a powerful model that can be used to perform sentiment analysis on text input.
- **transformers**: Transformers is a popular library that provides tools for working with pre-trained models like RoBERTa. It provides an easy way to load and use pre-trained models, which makes it easy to build and deploy machine learning models.
